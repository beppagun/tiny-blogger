            <p>After months of leaks, Apple has finally announced the new iPhone 15 series. This year too, the company has introduced four models - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and a Pro Max version. There is no Ultra variant, which the leaks have been suggesting. From the USB-C port to Dynamic Island, Apple has made key changes to the design part of the new iPhones. Both standard and Pro models have received massive upgrades in terms of hardware as well. Here is a look at the specs, price, design and other details of the newly launched iPhone 15 series.<strong><p><p><nbsp><p><p>iPhone 15: Price revealed at Apple event</strong></p></p><nbsp><p><p>While the India price will be revealed in a few hours, the company has revealed that the price for the US market will start from $799. The India price will also be the same as last year's model. Similarly, the company has just increased the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the standard iPhone 15 Pro will cost the same as the old model in the US. This means that the Pro is priced at $999, whereas the Pro Max will cost you $1,199. The devices will go on sale in the US on September 22.</p></p>But, the prices for the Pro models have been hiked in the Indian market. In India, the price starts from Rs 1,34,900 for the iPhone 15 Pro model and the Pro Max will cost Rs 1,59,900. The iPhone 15 is priced at Rs 79,900 in India for the 128GB storage model and the Plus model will be on sale at Rs 89,900.<strong><p><p><nbsp><p><p>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro models: Design changes announced at Apple event</strong></p></p><nbsp><p><p>The iPhone 15 series has retained the old design. You will still see the same boxy design with a dual camera arrangement at the back. One of the biggest changes in the design is the addition of a USB Type C port at the bottom. Apple has finally dropped its Lightning port in iPhones, and so now people don't have to carry a different charger for their iPhones.</p></p>Another notable change that Apple has announced is the addition of a punch-hole display design on the front. Apple first introduced punch-hole displays with the launch of the iPhone 14 Pro models last year. Many were disappointed that the same feature didn't make it to the standard models, but this has now changed. All the new iPhone 15 models now have Dynamic Island feature.</p><p>Apple has also replaced the mute switch button with a new Action Button. With this, users can quickly access shortcuts, access accessibility features, launch the camera, activate the flashlight, and perform a range of other tasks. While its default function remains as a ringer switch, it offers the potential for users to unlock a multitude of additional functionalities, making it a versatile tool you'll want to utilize for more than just adjusting your phone's ringer. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will be available in new colors - Pink, yellow, green, blue, and black.</p><p><strong>iPhone 15: Specs revealed</strong></p><p>The iPhone 15 continues to offer a compact form factor and sports a 6.1-inch liquid Retina display similar to the iPhone 14 and all the previous iPhone models. The Plus model also retained the 6.7-inch screen.</p><p>The iPhone 15 has received a major upgrade in the camera department. The standard and the Plus model offer a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, which is a massive upgrade over the 12-megapixel dual camera system seen on last year's model. This hardware is identical to what was introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro last year, complete with a fresh telephoto feature integrated into the Camera app. There are a new night mode, Smart HDR mode and other camera modes for better photography experience.</p><p>Users will also be able to record 4K videos. Apple says the new portrait mode offers enhanced bokeh effects, quicker shutter speeds, and more convenient access. One will also be able to take advantage of focus and depth control options within portrait mode for even greater creative control. At the rear, the secondary sensor is a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera boasting an f/1.6 aperture and sensor shift stabilization. Additionally, the new standard models feature a 12-megapixel TrueDepth front-facing camera for high-quality selfies and Face ID capabilities.</p>
